MiniSudoku
This is a small Sudoku game demo I wrote just for fun. It is fully working in all current Browsers and even on mobile devices also the lack of an physical keyboard makes it harder to use.

To play the game you just click the field and enter the number pressing 1-9 or 0 to delete the field.

The whole JS code including the board rendering is only 71 lines.
